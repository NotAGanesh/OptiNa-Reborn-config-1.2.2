**Note: 1.20.6 requires Java 21. Update your launcher and [download Java here.](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)**

### ⚠️ Caution: **We recommend against switching to this version due to several missing features. If you require the OptiFine feature, we suggest using v1.1.5 instead, if you have an desire to play 1.20.6 with all features we are suggesting for an Major Release (Release Channel)**

in this Third beta of OptiNa Reborn. we are adding Dynamic Lights! and some major features improved!

**Better Grass control moved!** Now you can enable/disable it directly in Video Settings, or change its graphics mode to fancy/fast for a customized look. you don't need to activate resource pack


Heads up! Version 1.21 is coming out on June 13th, 2024. We're working diligently to add support for it as soon as possible.

However, it’s important to note that some mods may still have bugs and glitches due to the early stage of development. Our team is actively working to address these issues and improve overall stability and mod developer too. and crashes are common problem.


**Note: if you are using Modrinth App than you need to update the launcher for Java 21**
