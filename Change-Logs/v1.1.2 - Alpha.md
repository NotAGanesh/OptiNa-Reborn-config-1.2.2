**Note: 1.20.6 requires Java 21. Update your launcher and [download Java here.](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)**

**We recommend against switching to this version due to several missing features. If you require the OptiFine feature, we suggest using v1.0.8 instead**

In this alpha release, we are excited to introduce support for the [`1.20.6`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.20.6). This update brings several enhancements, including the addition of eight new wolf variations and more.

However, itâ€™s important to note that some mods may still have bugs and glitches due to the early stage of development. Our team is actively working to address these issues and improve overall stability and mod developer too.
