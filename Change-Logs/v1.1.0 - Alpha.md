**Note: 1.20.5 requires Java 21. Update your launcher and [download Java here.](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)**

**We recommend against switching to this version due to several missing features. If you require the OptiFine feature, we suggest using v1.0.8 instead or wait for Release Version**

In this alpha, weâ€™ve brought back changes that were previously removed during the earlier alpha phase because they were outdated.
