**Note: 1.20.6 requires Java 21. Update your launcher and [download Java here.](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)**

### ⚠️ Caution: **We recommend against switching to this version due to several missing features. If you require the OptiFine feature, we suggest using v1.1.5 instead, if you have an desire to play 1.20.6 with all features we are suggesting for an Major Release (Release Channel)**

in this alpha release. we are adding our old removed mods. due to 1.20.6 not supported. and update mods

However, it’s important to note that some mods may still have bugs and glitches due to the early stage of development. Our team is actively working to address these issues and improve overall stability and mod developer too. and crashes are common problem.


**Note: if you are using Modrinth App than you need to update the launcher for Java 21**
