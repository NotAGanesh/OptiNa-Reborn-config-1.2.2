in this alpha release. we are adding our old removed mods. due to 1.20.6 not supported. and update mods

However, itâ€™s important to note that some mods may still have bugs and glitches due to the early stage of development. Our team is actively working to address these issues and improve overall stability and mod developer too. and crashes are common problem.
